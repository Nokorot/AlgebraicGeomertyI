\begin{exercise}[2]
We have 
\begin{align*}
F &: \Sh (X) \to \Sh_\B(X) ; \quad \F \mapsto \F|_{\B^\op} \\
G &: \Sh_\B (X) \to \Sh(X) ; \quad \F \mapsto (U \mapsto \invlim_{V \subset U, V
\in \B} \F(V)).
\end{align*}

We consider $U' \subset U \subset X$ open subsets. Then for any $V', V \in \B$
such that $V' \subset V \subset U$, we have the following commutative diagram

\[ \begin{tikzcd}
\invlim_{W \in U'} \F(W) \arrow[r] \arrow[rd] & \F(V') 
& \invlim_{W \in U'} \F(W) \arrow[l] \arrow[ld] \\
& \F(V') &
\end{tikzcd} \]



We need to show that there exists natural isomorphisms $\eta : F \circ G \to
\Id_{\Sh_\B(X)}$ and $\xi : G \circ F \to \Id_{\Sh(X)}$.

We have 
\[ F \circ G: \Sh_{\B}(X) \to \Sh_{\B}(X); \F \mapsto 
\left(U \mapsto \invlim_{V \subset U, V \in \B} \F(V) \right).  \]

Since $U \in \B$ defines a final object in $\B$, $\F(U)$ is an initial in the
diagram. So $\invlim_{V \subset U, V \in \B} \F(V)$ is isomorphic to $\F(U)$, by
a unique isomorphism.

Similarly for the other composition, we have 
\[ G \circ F: \Sh(X) \to \Sh(X); \F \mapsto 
\left(U \mapsto \invlim_{V \subset U, V \in \B} \F(V) \right),  \]
but now $U$ is not in general in $\B$. However, $\F(U)$ still satisfy
the universal property of the inverse limit and is thus the limit up to a unique
isomorphism (that we will denote $\eta_U$). That is, the following diagram
commutes:
\[  \begin{tikzcd}
\F(U) \arrow[rd] \arrow[r, "\phi"] & \F(V) \arrow[d] \\
& \F(V') 
\end{tikzcd} \]

It remains to show that the unique isomorphisms above assemble into natural
transformations.

Let $U$ and $U'$ are open subsets of $X$, such that $U' \subset U$ and $L$ and $L'$ be limits of the
diagrams $(\F(V))_{V \subset U, V \in \B}$ and $(\F(V))_{V \subset U', V \in
\B}$, respectively. 



By the above arguments there exists unique isomorphisms
$\eta_U$ and $\eta_{U'}$ from $L$ to $\F(U)$ and from $L'$ to $\F(U')$,
respectively. We want to show that the following diagram commutes

\[\begin{tikzcd}

\end{tikzcd} \]
