\begin{enumerate}
\item Define $f\in k[X_1,...,X_n]$ by $f(x) = \prod_{y \inZ} (x - y)$ for $x
\in \A^n(k)$. Then 
\[ V(f) = \{ x \in \A^n(k) \q: f(x) =0 \} = Z. \] Hence $Z$ is
closed wrt. the Zariski topology.
\item
The Zariski closed subsets of $\A^1(k)$ are precisely the finite subsets,
so the product topology on $\A^1(k) \times \A^1(k)$ is precisely the
finite subsets. However 
\[ \{ (x,-x) \q: x\in k \} = \{ (x,y) \q: x+y = 0 \}, \]
which is not finite (assuming $k$ is not finite), is closed in $\A^2(k)$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution} 


\begin{solution}[2]
Let $f \in k[X_1,...,X_{n}]$ be non-constant. Then there exists $x_1 \ne x_2 \in
\A^n(k)$ such that $f(x) \ne f(y)$. 
Define $g \in k[X]$, by 
\[ g(x) = f(x x_1 + (1-x) x_2), \]
then $g$ is polynomial of one variable that is non-constant, since $g(0) =
f(x_2) \ne f(x_1) = g(1)$. 
So since $k$ is algebraically closed there exists $y \in k$ such that $g(y) =
0$ and thus 
\[ f(y x_1 - y x_2 + x_2) = 0, \]
hence $y (x_1 - x_2) + x_2$Â is a zero of $f$.
\end{solution}
