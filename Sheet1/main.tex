\begin{enumerate}
\item Define $f\in k[X_1,...,X_n]$ by $f(x) = \prod_{y \in Z} (x - y)$ for $x
\in \A^n(k)$. Then 
\[ V(f) = \{ x \in \A^n(k) \q: f(x) =0 \} = Z. \] Hence $Z$ is
closed wrt. the Zariski topology.
\item
The Zariski closed subsets of $\A^1(k)$ are precisely the finite subsets,
so the product topology on $\A^1(k) \times \A^1(k)$ is precisely the
finite subsets. However 
\[ \{ (x,-x) \q: x\in k \} = \{ (x,y) \q: x+y = 0 \}, \]
which is not finite (assuming $k$ is not finite), is closed in $\A^2(k)$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution} 

\begin{solution}[2]
Let $f \in k[X_1,...,X_{n}]$ be non-constant. Then there exists $x_1 \ne x_2 \in
\A^n(k)$ such that $f(x) \ne f(y)$. 
Define $g \in k[X]$, by 
\[ g(x) = f(x x_1 + (1-x) x_2), \]
then $g$ is polynomial of one variable that is non-constant, since $g(0) =
f(x_2) \ne f(x_1) = g(1)$. 
So since $k$ is algebraically closed there exists $y \in k$ such that $g(y) =
0$ and thus 
\[ f(y x_1 - y x_2 + x_2) = 0, \]
hence $y (x_1 - x_2) + x_2$Â is a zero of $f$.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[3]
\begin{enumerate}
\item By def
\item
Define $g(x_1, ..., x_{n+1}) = f(x_1, ..., x_n)x_{n+1} - 1$, then 
\begin{equation}
V(I(X)\cup\{g\}) = \im(D(f)) \subseteq \A^{n+1}(k),
\label{eq:*}
\end{equation}
where $\iota : I(X) \hookrightarrow k[x_1,..., x_{n+1}]$ in the obvious way.

\underline{proof of \pref{eq:*}} 
So the inclusion $\iota$ gives $V(I(X)) = X \times k \subseteq \A^{n+1}(k)$ ans clearly $g(x_1, ..., x_{n+1}) = 0$ implies $x_{n+1} = f^{-1}(x_1,...,x_n)$. So 
\begin{align*}
V(I(X) \cup \{g\}) &= V(I(X)) \cap V(g) \\
&= \{ (x_1,...,x_n, f^{-1}(x_1,...,x_n)) \in X \q: (x_1,...,x_n) \in X \text{ and } f(x_1, ..., x_n) \ne 0 \}, 
\end{align*}
which is clearly equal to $\im(D(f))$.

It remains to show that the coordinate ring of $\im(D(f))$ is given by the localisation $A[f^{-1}]$.

By \pref{eq:*} we have that the coordinate ring is given by 
\[ C = k[x_1,...,x_{n+1}] / (I(X)\cup \left<g\right>) \cong  A / \left<g\right> \]
Define $\psi: A[f^{-1}] \to A / \left<g\right>$ by sending $\frac{1}{f}$ to $x_{n+1}$ and $x_i$ to itself. This is well defined since $f x_{n+1} = 1$ in $A / \left<g\right>$ and also clearly a homeomorphism. $\psi$ is also clearly an isomorphism since it is bijective on the generators.
\end{enumerate}
